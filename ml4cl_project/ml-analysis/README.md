# Readme

This directory contains all files used for the machine learning analysis. There is no shared main file.

The files starting with **ml_experiment-???.py** contain the separate experiments differentiated according to a) classification task, and b) features used.
These files are designed for step-wise execution, not for a single run-through.


The other files are helpers, which contain functions used throughout all or some experiments.
